The number of digits is constant and zeros are added at the beginning.\nIn the case of larger numbers, e.g.'1948', it will be written as it is, without any leading zeros.\n\nExamples:\n\nNumber of digits is 3\nFI2018/004, FI2018/053, FI2018/3432\n\nNumber of digits is 5\nFI2018/00008, FI2018/03465, FI2018/45372\n\nNo leading zeros\nFI2018/4, FI2018/25, FI2018/8476",

If you want to get a full date separated by dashes, e.g. '2018/10/03', you have to copy variables in this sequence: year, month, and day, paste them in the prefix or postfix fields and separate variables with a '/' or '{{YYYY}}/{{MM}}/{{DD}}'.",
