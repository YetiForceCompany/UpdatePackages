This functionality is used to limit the Account's excessive debt in permanent cooperation. Merchant limits are mainly granted to these Accounts who cooperate with us for a longer period of time and we want to extend their payment deadline, which means that the Account won't be able to place a new order unless his previous balance has been regulated [current balance and issued document exceed granted limit].",
