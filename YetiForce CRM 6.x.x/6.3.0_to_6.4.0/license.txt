- The picklist dependencies functionality has been rebuilt. All existing entries have been deleted. The system will try to restore the dependencies, however everything should be verified after the update.
- The SMSNotifier module has been significantly modernized. M-M relations involving this module will be deleted. Entries in this module will not be deleted, although it’s recommended to permanently delete them after the update.
- The update deactivates the record collector mechanism. You can re-activate it after the update in the Software configuration > Integration > Record collectors panel
- Operations on the main database tables will be performed during the update. If you have a lot of data, consider updating from within the CLI level to avoid exceeding various time limits.
